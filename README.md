# Ball-Game
The main code files are included in the directory /Assets/Scripts/
The Game is unity based but we couln't convert it into an app but we have enclosed the screenshots of the game working.
We couldn't include the game binary files as their count is too much and github doesn't allow uploading so many files at once
